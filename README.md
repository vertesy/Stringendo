# Stringendo - a string parsing library ![status: active](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vertesy/TheCorvinas/master/GitHub/Badges/active.svg)

String parsing functionalites for generating plotnames, filenames and path. Used by most of my other packages, including [CodeAndRoll2](https://github.com/vertesy/CodeAndRoll2) and [ggExpress](https://github.com/vertesy/ggExpress). 
Many functionalities were part of the formerly used [CodeAndRoll (v1)](https://github.com/vertesy/CodeAndRoll).



<br><br>

## Installation

Install directly from **GitHub** via **devtools** with one R command:

```R
# install.packages("devtools"); # If you don't have it.
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/Stringendo")
```

...then simply load the package:

```R
require("Stringendo")
```

Alternatively, you simply source it from the web. 
*This way function help will not work, and you will have no local copy of the code on your hard drive.*

```R
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vertesy/Stringendo/main/R/Stringendo.R")
```

<br>

### Troubleshooting

*If you encounter a **bug**, something doesn't work or unclear, please let me know by raising an issue on [Stringendo ](https://github.com/vertesy/Stringendo/issues) â€“ Please check if it has been asked.*

## List of Functions in Stringendo.R (67) 
Updated: 2024/10/24 11:02

- #### 1 `stopif()`
Stop execution if condition is TRUE.   The `stopif()` function stops the execution if the condition is `TRUE`. It is the opposite of  `stopifnot()`, which stops if the condition is not `TRUE`. This function is useful to increase  clarity in the code by removing double negations. 

- #### 2 `warnifnot()`
Issue warnings if conditions are not TRUE.   The `warningifnot()` function checks whether each condition passed to it is `TRUE`. If any  condition is not met, a warning is issued but the execution continues. This is similar to  `stopifnot()`, which throws an error and halts execution, but `warningifnot()` only issues a  warning, allowing the program to proceed. 

- #### 3 `warnif()`
Issue a warning if condition is TRUE.   The `warnif()` function issues a warning if the condition is `TRUE`. It is the opposite of  `warningifnot()`, which warns if the condition is not `TRUE`. This function is useful for issuing  warnings when a certain condition is met. 

- #### 4 `testNumericCompatible()`
Test if a Variable is Inherently Numeric ('0.1' as numeric).   This function checks if a given variable is inherently numeric. It returns TRUE if the variable  can be converted to a numeric value without loss of information and is not inherently a  character string, otherwise it returns FALSE. 

- #### 5 `"%!in%"()`
Negation of the `in` (w. grapes) operator. `%!in%` is used to test if elements of one vector are not present in another vector.  It is the negation of the `%in%` operator. This operator returns `TRUE` for elements  of `x` that are not in `y`. 

- #### 6 `message2()`
Message without collapsing. This function prints a message for each element in a character vector, instead of  collapsing them into a single line as done by, `message()`.

- #### 7 `imessage()`
imessage. A variant to message() pasting with white space, sibling of iprint().

- #### 8 `HasNames()`
iprint. A more intelligent printing function that collapses any variable passed to it by white spaces.

- #### 46 `toDotSeparated()`
Convert String to Dot Separated Name. Converts a string from camelCase or underscore_separated format to dot.separated.name format.  Inserts dots before each uppercase letter (except if it's the first character) or replaces underscores with dots,  and then converts the entire string to lowercase.
